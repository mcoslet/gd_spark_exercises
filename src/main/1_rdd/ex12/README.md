# Top-k most critical sensors
## Input
1) A testual csv file containing the daily value of PM10 for a set of sensors<br>
Each line of the files has the following format:<br> `sensorId,date,PM10 value (Î¼g/m3)\n`
<br><br>
The value of k <br>
It is an argument of the application

## Output: sensors ordered by the number of critical days
Data containing the top-k critical sensors<br>
The "criticality" of a sensor is given by the number of days with a PM10 values greater than 50<br>
Each line contains the number of critical days and the sensorId
